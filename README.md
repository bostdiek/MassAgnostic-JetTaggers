# Mass Agnostic Jet Taggers

Explore the different methods to decorrelate jet mass from ML taggers.

## Getting started
For reproducibility, we have included the environment we used.
To generate this environment (conda is required)
### Environment
```
make create_environment
conda activate massagnosticjettaggers
```
### Data
All of the preprocessing of the data can be done with `make data`
### Models
The models have already been trained, and the training takes quite a bit of time. However, they can be retrained using
```
make base_nn
make uBoost
```
